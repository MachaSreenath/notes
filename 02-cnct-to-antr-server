### To connect to the server-2 with the public ip of that server-2 from server-1.

sshpass -p "DevOps321" ssh centos@<public-ip>


### Another one is, to create any text file in server-2 without logging inside the server-2 from server-1.

sshpass -p "DevOps321" ssh centos@<public-ip> -C "echo Hello > /tmp/hello.txt"

==> Here, we just created hello.txt in server-2 from server-1 without logging into server-2.
